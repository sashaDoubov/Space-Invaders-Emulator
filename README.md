Space Invaders-Emulator Project Overview
========================================================================

This project emulates the Intel 8080 processor and uses SDL2 graphics,
to play Space Invaders with the original ROM files!


Obtain your own invaders.h,invaders.g,invaders.e,invaders.f and paste
them in the ROM files folder

// Due to the gray legal area in which emulators reside in

###Controls:

**Insert Coin**: 'c'

| Action  	|Player 1|  Player 2|
| :---:|:-------------:| :-----:|
|Start | '1' 		   | '2'|
|Shoot | Space Bar	   | 'w'|
|Left  | Left Arrow	   |'a'	|
|Right |Right Arrow	   |'d'	|

...
	

This project was inspired by  http://emulator101.com/,
an amazing resource! 

There are major differences, as that code was designed for Mac,
so this one uses windows specific libraries for graphics and input
(SDL2)

This was my first emulator, so this was a learning project
Hope you enjoy!
