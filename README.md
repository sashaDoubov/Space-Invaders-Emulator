Space Invaders Emulator
========================================================================

This project emulates the Intel 8080 processor and uses SDL2 graphics, 
to play Space Invaders with the original ROM files!


Obtain your own ROM files and paste them into the ROM folder.

// Due to the gray legal area in which emulators reside in


(runs in x64 modes)

| Action  	|Player 1|  Player 2|
| :---:|:-------------:| :-----:|

I would like to give credit to the http://emulator101.com/ page, which both inspired this project
and guided me through some of the tough areas.



This was my first emulator, so this was a learning project

**Hope you enjoy!**
