Space Invaders-Emulator Project Overview
========================================================================

This project emulates the Intel 8080 processor, to play Space Invaders
with the original ROM files!

Obtain your own invaders.h,invaders.g,invaders.e,invaders.f and paste
them in the ROM files folder
// Due to the gray legal area in which emulators reside in

HOW TO PLAY:
Insert Coin: 'c'
1 Player							2 player (player 1 uses same keys)
	Start:	'1'							Start: '2'
	Shoot:	Space Bar					Shoot:	'w'
	Left:	Left Arrow					Left:	'a'
	Right:	Right Arrow					Right:	'd'

This project was inspired by the http://emulator101.com/,
an amazing resource! 

There are major differences, as that code was designed for Mac,
so this one uses windows specific libraries for graphics and input
(SDL2)

This was my first emulator, so this was a learning project
Hope you enjoy!
